    <title>CSS Base - A collection of CSS files.</title>

    <h1>CSS Base</h1>
    <h2>A collection of CSS files.</h2>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>
        I like to have web pages to accompany the things I do and I like to play 
        around with the way those pages look. At a certain point I ended up 
        wanting to re-use one look or another which lead to CSS files being 
        copy/pasted all over the place.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course this would not do...    
    </p>

    <h3>The solution</h3>
    <p>
        It dawned on me I might as well just put all the CSS files I tend to 
        recycle together in a single location. This would also improve 
        re-usability. As some revision control is always nice, a git repo seemed 
        as good a place as any.
    </p>
    <p>
        As Github is graceful enough to offer us free webhosting, having the 
        files online makes it even easier to include and re-use them. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So here we are...
    </p>
    
    <h3>The Collection</h3>
    <p>
        The following CSS files are available:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><a href="./css/code.css">code.css</a></dt>
        <dd>
            When you use code examples on a page, this will add some niceties to
            the code blocks, like a description (based on the "rel" attribute)
            and a counter (using <code>H2</code> tags as chapters).
        </dd>
        <dt><a href="./css/keyboard.css">keyboard.css</a></dt>
        <dd>
            When you use the <code>KBD</code> tag on a page, this will add make
            it display as an actual keyboard button (distinctly different from
            form buttons, mind you). Includes hover state for fun and confusion.
        </dd>
        <dt><a href="./css/ribbon.css">ribbon.css</a></dt>
        <dd>
            Would you like a ribon on a page, like the one on this page? How 
            about one that is 100% CSS. No images involved! Based on <a 
            href="http://blog.terrenceryan.com/github-ribbons-in-css/"> the 
            excellent work by Terrence Ryan</a>, this is the one for you!
